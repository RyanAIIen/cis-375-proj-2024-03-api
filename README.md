# CIS-375 Project - Hotel Management API

https://cis-375-proj-2024-03-api.vercel.app/

# Getting Started

This project is a [Python](https://www.python.org/about/) /
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) back-end application.

You will need to have Python installed for development. Many modern operating
systems have Python install already. Open a terminal and run `python --version`
to check. If it is not installed, download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate # Linux & macOS
# or
venv/Scripts/activate.bat # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now view the app running in your browser: http://localhost:8000.

**Note:** You will have to reactivate the virtual environment any time you begin
a new terminal session.
